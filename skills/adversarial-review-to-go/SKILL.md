# Adversarial Review to GO

For design-sensitive or concurrency-sensitive work, one review pass is not
enough. Run an external adversarial reviewer (the reviewer-strong agent in the
roster), re-verify each finding yourself, patch the valid ones minimally, and —
**on a finite surface** — review again until a round produces zero surviving
findings ("GO").

Two things decide whether that loop is right: **what surface you are reviewing**
(below) and **what altitude the reviewer is locked to**
([references/review-prompts.md](references/review-prompts.md)). Get either wrong
and the rounds stop converging.

This is the delegated-reviewer counterpart to
`superpowers:receiving-code-review` — apply that skill's discipline (act on
valid feedback, push back with reasoning on invalid feedback) to an external
agent's output.

## Where the Loop Applies

Converging to zero assumes the surface being reviewed is **finite**. A diff is:
patching it changes bounded code. A document is not: every patch writes new
prose, and new prose is new surface to attack. Run the wrong loop on a document
and you get growth, not convergence.

| Surface | Rounds | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **Diff / implemented code** | loop until zero → GO | Finite surface. The last round is where subtle findings surface. |
| **Spec** | **one round, then stop** | Each patch adds prose that invites the next finding. |
| **Plan** | **one round, then stop** | Same. Re-review only after the plan is restructured, not after wording fixes. |

Measured on a real document review: two rounds went **10 → 11** findings and the
document grew **300 → 720 lines**. That is not a slow convergence, it is a
different shape of curve.

## The Stop Rule

**If findings do not decrease across two consecutive rounds, stop. Do not run
another round.** A non-decreasing count is evidence about the *process*, not
about the artifact. Check, in this order:

1. **Altitude** — is the reviewer being invited to find things that belong one
   layer down? (Reviewing a spec with a source-file list attached is the
   classic.) Fix the prompt, not the artifact.
2. **Surface** — is this a document being run through the diff loop?
3. **Patch-induced findings** — see below.

Only after one of those is fixed does another round mean anything.

## Lock the Reviewer to the Altitude

Calibration has **two axes**, and the skill used to name only one.

**Severity** comes from `concept-briefing`'s `system-profile.md` — include it in
every review prompt: the trade-off priority order, the hard boundaries, the real
scale. Without it a reviewer applies generic best practice and you get noise in
both directions: scaling findings on a 200-user internal tool, or a shrug at a
boundary that must never break. A finding is only real relative to this system's
priorities. The profile does **not** soften the bar on what it names untouchable
— those are the findings to take most seriously.

**Altitude** comes from *what is being reviewed*, and it is what the prompt must
constrain. Three templates, one per artifact type, in
[references/review-prompts.md](references/review-prompts.md):

| Reviewing | Ask about | Forbid |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Spec** | decisions, missing constraints, DoD that can go green for the wrong reason | source-file lists, "check it against the code", mechanism |
| **Plan** | can each task actually run, are the dependencies real, does acceptance measure the *hardest* requirement | debating mechanism, rewriting the design |
| **Diff** | correctness at the cited site, gaps tests don't cover, seeded mutations | — file lists belong here |

Do not reach for one generic prompt and adjust it by feel. The controlled
comparison is stark: same model, same document, prompt switched to lock altitude
⇒ implementation-layer findings dropped to **0** (previously the majority) and
**3/10** findings were "cut this, it belongs in the plan".

## Patches Breed Findings

**Round N+1 reviews the round-N patches first.** Say so in the prompt, and name
the patched sites.

In the measured document review, **6 of 11** round-2 findings were caused by the
round-1 patch itself. A reviewer that treats round N+1 as a fresh sweep spends
its attention on the parts nobody touched, and the newest, least-reviewed text
gets the least scrutiny — exactly backwards.

## Ask for the Reverse Altitude Check

Alongside "what is missing", ask the reviewer for **what is present that belongs
one layer down and should be cut**. Reviewers volunteer additions by default;
subtraction has to be requested.

This is what keeps a spec from drifting into plan territory over successive
rounds, and it is directly measurable: 3 of 10 findings in the calibrated round
were cuts. A document that only ever grows under review has been told, by
omission, that growth is the only allowed outcome.

## Every Finding Ships With Fix Options

A finding with no fix is a bug report: it hands the owner a blank page at the
exact moment the context is freshest in the reviewer's head. **Every finding
carries 1-2 proposed fixes** — required output, not a courtesy.

Each finding has these fields, in this order:

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Finding** | what is wrong, at the cited place |
| **Failure** | the concrete consequence — inputs or interleaving → wrong result. Not "risky" |
| **Fix options** | 1-2 directions. Each: the approach and where it applies, in at most two sentences, plus its cost — what it breaks, slows, or postpones |
| **Recommended** | which option, and why — or "owner decides" plus what the decision turns on |

A second option only when it takes a **different approach**. The same fix at two
sizes is one option.

**A fix option is a direction, not a patch.** Name the approach and the place it
applies, then stop. Two sentences is the whole budget — no code, no diff, no
rewritten paragraph, no line numbers. The detail belongs to whoever re-verifies
the finding on real source, because only they can see what the surrounding code
actually allows.

| Right size | Too deep |
|------------|----------|
| "Guard the read-modify-write in `applyQuota` with a compare-and-swap on the version field — costs a retry loop." | the 30-line patch that implements the CAS |
| "State the retention limit as a constraint in §3 instead of leaving it to the plan." | the rewritten §3, drafted for you |
| "Split T4 — the migration and the backfill touch the same table and cannot run in parallel." | a re-sequenced task list with new IDs |

A fix option that no longer fits in two sentences has stopped being a direction
and become the implementation — which is the owner's work, and only after the
finding is confirmed. An over-detailed option costs twice: the reviewer spends
its attention drafting instead of finding, and the draft is persuasive enough to
get applied without the check.

**Fix options inherit the review's altitude**, exactly as findings do:

| Reviewing | A fix option looks like |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Spec** | which decision to take instead, or what constraint the spec is missing — named, not drafted |
| **Plan** | which task to split, which dependency to reorder, what the acceptance should measure |
| **Diff** | where the guard belongs and what kind — the smallest one that holds, not the code for it |

A spec review that answers with a patch has dropped an altitude — the same defect
as attaching a source-file list to the prompt, arriving from the other end.

**They are suggestions, and the Golden Rule still runs.** A proposed fix is the
reviewer's hypothesis about a defect you have not confirmed yet. Confirm the
finding on real source first, then decide whether either option is the right
patch. A well-written fix option is the most persuasive thing in the report and
the easiest to apply without looking — which is precisely why re-verification
comes first.

## Seed Mutations (Diff Reviews)

Green tests prove the code runs. They do not prove the tests are watching the
right thing. Require the reviewer to:

1. Copy the repo to a scratch directory.
2. For **each constraint the task claims to satisfy**, seed a deliberate defect —
   preferring the failure modes the handoff itself called classic.
3. Run the suite and report **which mutations were not caught**.

At a real gate this caught 4/4 seeded mutations, including the exact trap the
handoff had flagged. Without it, a green suite of hundreds of tests is evidence
of very little.

## The Golden Rule

**Always re-verify each finding against the real source yourself. Never apply
findings blindly.** The external reviewer is fast and catches things e2e can't
(crash-gap, TOCTOU, migration-on-deploy), but it is also sometimes wrong or
wrong about severity. For each finding:

1. Confirm it on the actual code (reproduce the reasoning at the cited site).
2. If valid — weigh the reviewer's fix options against what the code actually
   shows, then patch minimally (prefer a CAS/guard at the exact contention point
   over a broad rewrite) and re-verify with `checkpoint-verification`. Taking an
   option unchanged is fine once you have confirmed it at the site; taking it
   because the reviewer wrote it well is the failure.
3. If invalid or overstated — push back with the code/test that disproves it,
   and record why it was rejected.
4. Surface rejected findings to the user for a decision when they involve a
   real trade-off (e.g. distributed primitive vs in-process guard). Same for any
   finding the reviewer marked "owner decides" — pass both options up as written,
   with their costs, rather than picking one quietly.

This one is not a theory: across a full delivery, 21 of 21 findings survived
independent re-verification and none were rejected — which is exactly why the
rule is cheap to keep and expensive to skip the one time it matters.

## The Round Loop (diff)

```
round = 1
repeat:
    dispatch external reviewer on the current diff
        (self-contained prompt: plan pointer + diff scope + system-profile;
         round > 1: name the previous round's patched sites, review them first;
         require seeded mutations for every claimed constraint;
         require the finding format: finding + failure + 1-2 fix options + recommendation)
    for each finding: re-verify on source → choose among the fix options
                      → patch-if-valid / rebut-if-not
    re-run checkpoint-verification (2 consecutive green where applicable)
    if findings did not decrease over the last two rounds: STOP, check altitude
    round += 1
until a round yields zero surviving findings  → GO
```

For a spec or a plan: dispatch once, re-verify, patch, **stop**. Re-review only
if the artifact was restructured, not because wording changed.

## Practical Notes

- Keep each review prompt self-contained (pointer + scope + profile) so a fresh
  reviewer thread works — don't rely on a giant resumed context.
- The reviewer may run out of quota mid-loop. A purely formal confirmation round
  can be skipped if the user agrees; already-verified mechanical fixes don't
  need another round.
- Record the convergence (e.g. "4 rounds, 5→2→1→0") and the accepted residual
  trade-offs in the merge commit or plan notes. Record a non-convergence too,
  with what the altitude check found — that is a `lessons-ledger` entry.

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Reviewer flagged it, just apply it" | Re-verify on source first. Reviewers are sometimes wrong. |
| "One round was clean enough" | On a diff, converge to zero. The last round is where subtle ones surface. |
| "Findings went up — run another round" | Findings went up because the surface grew or the altitude is wrong. Another round makes it worse. |
| "I'll give the reviewer the file list so it can check properly" | On a spec or plan that is the bug. It invites implementation-layer findings you then patch into the document. |
| "The reviewer will figure out what layer to work at" | It will not. It answers the prompt you wrote; a file list is an instruction. |
| "Round 2 should look at everything again" | Round 2 looks at round 1's patches first. That is where the new defects are. |
| "149 tests pass, the constraint holds" | Tests prove it runs. Seed a mutation to prove they are watching. |
| "Rewrite the whole thing to be safe" | Patch minimally at the contention point. Broad rewrites add risk. |
| "Rejecting this finding, moving on" | If it's a real trade-off, the user decides — surface it. |
| "The reviewer wrote a fix, apply it" | The fix rests on a finding you have not confirmed. Verify at the site, then choose. |
| "Findings only — proposing the fix is my job" | Then every finding starts from a blank page. 1-2 options are required output; the choice is still yours. |
| "Ask for three or four options to compare" | Two different approaches, max. A menu shifts the thinking back onto you and dilutes the reviewer's reasoning. |
| "Handy patch for my spec finding" | Spec fixes are decisions and constraints. A patch means the reviewer dropped an altitude — reject it like a file-list finding. |
| "It shipped working code, that saves me a step" | Code written against source the reviewer only partly saw. Take the direction, write the change yourself after confirming the finding. |
| "More detail in the option means less work for me" | It means the reviewer spent its attention drafting instead of finding, and the draft is persuasive enough to get applied unchecked. |
| "Reviewer wants it hardened for scale" | Check the profile. On a one-replica internal tool that's noise; on the boundary it calls untouchable it's the opposite. |
