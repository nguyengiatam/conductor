# Orchestrating External Executors

You are the architect and reviewer. External coding agents (the "executors")
implement the plan one task at a time; you gate every task before the next begins.

This covers executors that are **separate tools with their own quotas, quirks, and
failure modes** — as opposed to subagents inside your own harness (on Claude Code,
`superpowers:subagent-driven-development` covers those). See *Knowing Your
Workforce* below for choosing between the two. Exact invocations live in
[references/executor-roster.md](references/executor-roster.md) — read it before
dispatching. Keep this skill's body agent-agnostic; all machine-specific commands
stay in the roster.

## Roles

Four roles. One agent may hold several — with one exception that is never
negotiable.

| Role | Does | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Coordinator** (you) | Splits work, dispatches, monitors, verifies, decides | Never delegate this |
| **Plan author** | Turns a short spec into a task-by-task plan with real code | Often worth delegating: plans are long to write and cheap to review |
| **Executor** | Implements exactly one task, then stops | May be several in parallel |
| **Adversarial reviewer** | Stress-tests the result — see `adversarial-review-to-go` | Prefer a different agent than the one that wrote the code |

**The non-negotiable: whoever writes the code does not get to certify it.** An
executor that writes both the function and its tests has proven only that the code
matches itself. When accepting such work, compute the expected numbers yourself
from the fixtures and check the output against *those* — not against the
executor's assertions. This is what makes it safe to delegate even business
logic: the rigor moves to verification instead of staying in authorship.

You may write code yourself for foundation, concurrency-critical, or verification
code where precision beats delegation. Also for **purely mechanical work already
spelled out in the plan** — arguing with a weak executor costs more than typing it.

## Selecting an Executor

**Check quota across the whole roster before assigning heavy work**, not just for
the one you intend to use — you need to know your fallbacks before you need them.

Then match work to agent:

| Work | Route to |
|------|----------|
| Writing detailed plans from a spec | The strongest reasoning agent available; you review rather than write |
| Business logic, algorithms, anything with a subtle contract | A capable executor **plus** independent verification of the numbers |
| Mechanical: scaffolding, copying modules, CRUD, enum plumbing | The cheapest agent with quota — or yourself if it's fully specified |
| Review of concurrency, migration, crash-gap | The review-strong agent, and never the one that wrote the code |

Check the project's team file first (see below) — it records who has been assigned
what here, and what each has actually proven.

Reserve quota on at least one agent as a fallback and second opinion. Running
every agent to zero leaves you unable to review what the last one produced.

## Knowing Your Workforce

Coordinating is a management job: you are expected to know who is available, what
each one is for, and what each has actually proven. Two distinct sources of labor:

| | **Subagent** (inside your own harness) | **External agent** (its own CLI) |
|---|---|---|
| Quota | Spends the **current session's** budget | Its own, independent budget |
| Start-up | Warm — inherits framing you provide cheaply | Cold — knows nothing, needs the context file |
| Observability | Tracked by your harness | Needs its own monitor; can die silently |
| Independence | Same model family, correlated blind spots | Genuinely different eyes |
| Best for | Work needing deep context; when external agents are out of quota | Preserving session budget; independent review |

**Which source to use is the user's call, not yours.** The two spend different
budgets — one burns the session the user is paying for right now, the other burns
a CLI quota that may be reserved for something else. Picking silently spends
resources on their behalf.

### First time a project needs a subagent — confirm

If the project has **no history of using subagents** (no team file, or no subagent
entry in it) and the work calls for one, **stop and ask** before dispatching:

- Subagent inside this session, or an external agent?
- If a subagent: which kind/model?
- What role — writing code, reviewing, or investigating?

Then **record the answer in the team file** so this is asked once, not every time.
When the team file already answers it, follow it silently; only come back to the
user when the situation falls outside what's recorded (a new role, or the recorded
choice is out of quota).

### The team file

`docs/superpowers/team.md` in the project — assignments belong to the project
(this project writes code with one model, the next may not), while
[the roster](references/executor-roster.md) holds what exists on this machine and
how to invoke it. Different lifetimes, different files.

**Record both wins and failures, each with evidence.** "Handled the aggregation
engine, 11 tasks, 491 tests green" and "went silent 15 minutes holding a pipe on a
DB script" are both assignments-relevant. Judgments without evidence decay into
prejudice, and you will either over-trust an agent that got lucky once or refuse
one that failed for a reason you've since fixed.

Update it when a phase ends, and whenever an agent surprises you in either
direction. An assignment table nobody maintains sends the next phase's work to
whoever happened to be listed first.

## Quota Management

Quota is a resource you allocate across a phase, not a thing you check once.

- **Silent exhaustion is the classic trap.** An agent out of quota often runs,
  prints a line of preamble, exits 0 with near-empty output — indistinguishable
  from "ran but did nothing" until you look for the work it didn't do. The roster
  documents each agent's quota-check command; run it rather than inferring from
  behavior.
- **Check before dispatching heavy or parallel work**, and re-check after a
  suspiciously fast or empty result.
- **Know the reset windows.** An agent that resets in a few hours is worth waiting
  for; one on a weekly window must be spent deliberately.
- **Budget by role.** Reviews are token-heavy and repeat over rounds; a converging
  review loop can cost more than the implementation did. Don't spend the reviewer's
  quota on implementation you could route elsewhere.
- When an agent goes quiet mid-task, **check quota before debugging the task** —
  it's the cheaper hypothesis.

## Dispatching One Task

A **checkpoint** is the reviewable unit: **one plan task → one commit on a feature
branch → executor stops → you review.** Enforce all of:

1. One task per handoff. The prompt names the single task, the current HEAD, the
   baseline test state, and this repo's safety rules.
2. The executor commits its own work (or stops without committing, if that's your
   convention) and halts.
3. You review before releasing the next task: `checkpoint-verification`, then
   `convention-commit-gate`, on the actual diff — never on the executor's summary.
4. Verification output is real and pasted. "Tests pass" without the run output is
   not acceptance.

If an executor violated the protocol (ran ahead, skipped verification, edited
another repo), stop and reconcile before continuing — do not paper over it.

### Handoff prompt checklist

- The single task and its acceptance criteria, copied from the plan.
- Current HEAD SHA and the baseline test count/state.
- **A pointer to the executor context file** (see `executor-context`) instead of
  restating project conventions, scope boundaries, test rules, and reporting
  requirements every time. If something is missing there, fix the file rather
  than growing the prompt.
- Any lesson specific to the area this task touches, as one constraint line —
  check `lessons-ledger` by area and work type.
- The instruction to reconcile against real code/enums before hardcoding anything.
  **When an executor stops to question the plan, take it seriously** — that is
  usually a hole in your handoff, not a defect in the executor.
- Safety rules for this dispatch: branch, port/DB isolation if parallel, which
  files another executor is currently holding.

## Monitoring Every Dispatch

**Every dispatch gets a monitor, attached at the moment of dispatch.** Not "I'll
check back" — an actual watch with an exit condition.

How you attach it depends on the harness, in this order of preference:

1. **Harness-tracked background work**, if your harness has it — it notifies you.
2. **A shell background job** that polls the exit condition and exits when met.
   Works anywhere with a shell, including harnesses that run dispatches
   synchronously.
3. **Neither available** → say plainly "no monitor — I'll poll next turn", and
   then actually poll. This is a worse option, not a forbidden one; what's
   forbidden is claiming option 1 or 2 while doing option 3.

Three rules, each paid for in lost time:

1. **Attach the monitor immediately when the executor is launched.** Exit
   condition is concrete: *a new commit appears*, *the process dies*, or *the log
   is silent past a threshold*. Not "the task finishes" — you cannot observe that.
2. **Capture the BASE commit at dispatch and pass it to the monitor.** Without a
   baseline, "a new commit appeared" is unanswerable, and you'll mistake an old
   commit for progress.
3. **Never describe a monitoring mechanism you did not actually start.** If you
   cannot set one up, say plainly: "no monitor — I'll poll next turn." Claiming a
   watch that was never running silently converts an idle executor into lost time,
   because nothing will tell you it stalled.

Rule 3 exists because it happened: a described-but-unstarted monitor cost half an
hour of a dead dispatch. The failure mode is specifically that everything *looks*
fine.

**Silence is ambiguous** — it can be an agent working, an agent out of quota, or a
process holding a pipe waiting for input that will never come. Distinguish them by
evidence: process state, quota check, log timestamps, and whether any file changed.
Prefer data over process liveness: a process that is still alive proves nothing
about whether the work is done, and one that exited proves nothing about whether
it succeeded.

## Running Executors in Parallel

Parallel dispatch is where throughput comes from, and where the coordinator's
mistakes get multiplied.

- **Partition by file, and say so explicitly in every prompt** — list the files
  each other executor is holding, with "do not touch, not even to fix an error."
- **Isolate shared resources**: ports, databases, fixture directories. Two
  executors sharing a test database will produce failures that belong to neither.
- **Warn that repo-wide lint/typecheck will show foreign errors.** Tell them to
  scope their own check to their files and to report which errors came from
  outside their scope — otherwise they will "helpfully" fix someone else's file
  and destroy the isolation.
- **Keep the checkpoint discipline per executor.** Parallel dispatch means several
  one-task handoffs at once, not one executor running several tasks.
- Prefer parallelizing tasks that share no interface. Two tasks touching the same
  contract should be sequential, however tempting the speedup looks.

## The Loop

```
read team.md → who is assigned what here; ask the user if a role is unfilled
for each task in plan:
    check quota across roster → pick executor (assignment + strength + quota)
    capture BASE commit
    dispatch ONE task (prompt → context file + task + area lessons)
    attach monitor immediately (exit: new commit / process dead / silence)
    executor implements + stops
    checkpoint-verification   (call-site + real runtime path; recompute expected numbers yourself)
    convention-commit-gate    (enums, no magic literals, commit style)
    fix or re-dispatch if a gate fails
    record any lesson learned  → lessons-ledger
    update team.md if an agent surprised you either way
when a risky area is complete, before merge:
    adversarial-review-to-go  (converge findings to GO)
then:
    finish/merge the branch (superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch on Claude Code)
```

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "The executor said tests pass, ship it" | Run `checkpoint-verification` yourself. Summaries hide skipped links. |
| "Its tests are green, the logic is right" | It wrote both. Recompute the expected values from fixtures and check against those. |
| "Let it do the next task too, this one looks fine" | One task per checkpoint. Unreviewed work compounds. |
| "I'll just assign it, quota is probably fine" | Check first. Silent quota failure looks exactly like "did nothing". |
| "Everything else is out of quota — I'll spin up a subagent" | That spends the user's current session instead. If the project has no subagent history, ask which kind and for what role. |
| "The user won't care which agent does this" | They pay for it, in different budgets. Silent substitution spends their resources for them. |
| "I remember this agent is bad at that" | Check the team file. If the memory isn't recorded with evidence, it's prejudice — and the reason it failed may already be fixed. |
| "I'll check on it in a while" | Attach a monitor at dispatch, with a real exit condition and a BASE commit. |
| "I've got a watcher on it" (but didn't start one) | Say "no monitor, I'll poll next turn." A described-but-unstarted watch costs you the whole idle period. |
| "It's been quiet, it must be working" | Silence is ambiguous. Check quota, process state, and whether any file changed. |
| "Process is still alive, so it's still working" | Liveness proves nothing. Check the data it should have produced. |
| "This tiny mechanical change — delegate it" | If it's fully specified, you're faster than the round-trip. |
| "The executor is wrong, override it" | When an executor stops to question the plan, it's often right. Verify against source before dismissing. |
| "It hit the same trap as last phase" | The lesson never reached it. Promote it into the executor context file — you are the constant in that pattern. |
| "I'll restate the conventions in this prompt" | Point at the context file and fix the file. Retyped conventions drift and get omitted under pressure. |
